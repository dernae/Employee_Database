# Overview

 The purpose of this analysis is to help a large company to determine which employees are eligible for a retirement package and
 which positions will need to be filled in the near future. To do so, a list of all the employees eligible for retirement 
 was generated. In addition, the company that formerly used Excel and VBA for these types of analysis, was interested 
 in switching to SQL. The entire analysis is done in that language with visualizations done in ERD.
 
# Results

 FROM DELIVERABLE 1
 
  - The number of employees eligible for a retirement package is 90,308.
  - The individuals retiring will leave Senior Engineer, Senior Staff, Engineer, Staff, Techique Leader, Assistant
      Engineer and Manager positions vacant. 
  - The Senior Engineer, Senior Staff, Engineer and Staff positions are the most imperative to fill. The number of
      employees retiring from these fields are 29,415, 28,255, 14,221 and 12,242 respectively.

# Summary

 Question 1:How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make a impact? 
 
    - There are 6 categories of employees that will retire:  Senior Engineer, Senior Staff, Engineer, Staff, Techique 
        Leader, Assistant Engineer and Manager. In total 90,308 roles will need to be filled; 29,415, 28,255, 14,221,
          12,242, 4502, 1,761 and 2 employees respective of the titles mentioned above. 
          
Question 2 Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?

    - There are 1,940 qualified, retirement-ready employees at this company. There aren't nearly enough of these employees
        needed to mentor the 90,308 roles that will be needed to fill. I recommend expanding the age limitation of the employees that 
          would be qualified, by 5 years.
